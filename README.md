# Project 1 - Eric Romrell

This project ended up being a lot of work,but even more fun. I do iOS development for my job, but I am normally very constrained in my creativity when doing app development. It was quite eye-opening and entertaining to find out what all I could do, especially building for only the latest iOS. Here are a couple of features that I got working and some struggles that I had:

* Overall
  * Figured out navigation bar coloring and status bar styling
* Opening page
  * Created custom cell layouts to load good looking HIG cells
  * Got highlighting and de-highlighting working
  * Figured out how to allow the user to delete items
  * Made empty cells at the bottom of the table disappear
* Profile page
  * Loaded image into a circle (dumb that you can't do that in the interface builder)
  * Figured out how to use horizontal stack views for contact option buttons
  * Created image sets (this took a particularly long amount of time)
  * Dynamically loaded information into a table view
  * Got edit functionality working, and took some time to make sure the UI was smooth and pretty
  * Made table non-selectable (disabled highlighting)
  * Struggled to load the paragraph data into the table (because both are scrollable)
  * Handled unknown or unprovided data
  * Used animations to help users understand that the image was editable as well
  * Figured out how to load an image from the camera or photo library
  * Tried to get the image to grow and shrink as the user scrolled through the table... It didn't look very pretty, so I removed it
